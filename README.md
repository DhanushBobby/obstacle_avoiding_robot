# Obstacle Avoiding Robot

The **Obstacle Avoiding Robot** is a project designed to navigate its way through a track while detecting and avoiding obstacles. The robot utilizes an Arduino Uno and is programmed using C++.

## Features

- Detects obstacles on the track and avoids collisions.
- Arduino Uno microcontroller for intelligent control.
- C++ programming for efficient obstacle avoidance algorithms.
- Simple setup and operation.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the robot is placed on the designated track.
2. Power on the robot using the provided switch.
3. If an obstacle is detected on the track, the robot will autonomously navigate around it without collisions.
4. The robot will continue to move along the track, detecting and avoiding obstacles as necessary.
